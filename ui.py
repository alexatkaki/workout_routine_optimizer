            2. Hash Table Implementation: We utilize O(1) time complexity for exercise searches, providing significantly faster and more relevant exercise selection than traditional methods.

            3. Supporting Structures: Your workout history is tracked in a stack data structure, while upcoming workouts are managed in a queue, ensuring comprehensive progress monitoring.

            The system analyzes your profile, exercise history, and preferences to generate workouts that are appropriately challenging and balanced across your target muscle groups.
