    "The only bad workout is the one that didn’t happen.",
    "Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency.",
    "Your body can stand almost anything. It’s your mind that you have to convince.",
    "The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, but rather a lack in will.",
    "Fitness is not about being better than someone else. It’s about being better than you used to be.",
    "Don’t limit your challenges. Challenge your limits.",
    "Strive for progress, not perfection.",
    "The pain you feel today will be the strength you feel tomorrow.",
    "It’s going to be a journey. It’s not a sprint to get in shape.",
    "Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you."
